# Pwning-Metasploitable
Notes and screenshots of how to enumerate and own Metasploitable2.

# What is this?
A repo of screenshots, notes, and exploits that can be used to attack [metasploitable2](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/). The CherryTree document(s) follow the [BOX-SKELETON](https://github.com/unmeg/hax/blob/master/BOX-SKELETON.ctb) template.
 

# Notes and Screenshots
Main notes are in the "notes.ctb". The CherryTree note taking application must be installed to use. Screenshots are of varying sizes and may document more findings than what is found in the notes.ctb file.
Additional notes will be uploaded as I continue pwning this thing. Seperate files will probably be utilized for the different web app attack simulations (DVWA, mutildae etc.).

# To Do
- Web App related stuff
- Vftp exploitation
- ~~Tomcat exploitation (With Metasploit)~~
- ~~Root via Dirty Cow~~
- phpMyAdmin exploitation
- ~~postgresql exploitation~~
- Many more stuff I might find

# Contributing
I like pull requests. Please feel free to contribute more findings, templates, exploits etc.
